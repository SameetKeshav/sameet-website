      I’m a Software Engineer with 2 years of experience building backend systems.
      My passion lies in building backend systems that are performant and writing clean, maintainable code.
      In my free time I am always trying to learn new Languages and Frameworks and putting these skills to use by creating small to medium sized projects.
